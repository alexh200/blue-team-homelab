# **SIEM & Enterprise Security Lab 🛡️**

## **🔹 Overview**

This project is designed to **simulate a corporate-style network environment** with multiple machines, servers, and security components. The goal is to create a **realistic and interactive cybersecurity lab** that enables hands-on experience with both **offensive (red team) and defensive (blue team) security concepts** **(but mostly blue team).**

By **building, configuring, and securing** a fully networked environment, this lab serves as a platform to **explore security tools, detect cyber threats, and investigate incidents**—all within a controlled and educational setting. Note that this lab serves as a learning tool for myself and hopefully anyone else who finds this GitHub project. I am no expert so feel free to fork and modify this as much as you want!

## **🎯 Project Goals**

✅ **Network Simulation** – Set up a multi-machine environment mimicking a small enterprise.
✅ **Security Hardening** – Implement **firewalls, system configurations, and endpoint protection**.
✅ **Log Collection & SIEM Integration** – Forward logs to a SIEM (Splunk, ELK, or Wazuh) for analysis.
✅ **Threat Detection** – Develop **custom detection rules** to catch malicious activity.
✅ **Incident Response & Forensics** – Simulate **attacks**, analyze logs, and document findings.
✅ **Red vs. Blue Training** – Execute **offensive techniques** (Kali, Metasploit) and detect them using defensive tools.
