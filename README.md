# **SIEM & Enterprise Security Lab 🛡️**

## **🔹 Overview**

This project is designed to **simulate a corporate-style network environment** with multiple machines, servers, and security components. The goal is to create a **realistic and interactive cybersecurity lab** that enables hands-on experience with both **offensive (red team) and defensive (blue team) security concepts** **(but mostly blue team).**

By **building, configuring, and securing** a fully networked environment, this lab serves as a platform to **explore security tools, detect cyber threats, and investigate incidents**—all within a controlled and educational setting. Note that this lab serves as a learning tool for myself and hopefully anyone else who finds this GitHub project. I am no expert so feel free to fork and modify this as much as you want!

## **🎯 Project Goals**

✅ **Network Simulation** – Set up a multi-machine environment mimicking a small enterprise.  
✅ **Security Hardening** – Implement **firewalls, system configurations, and endpoint protection**.  
✅ **Log Collection & SIEM Integration** – Forward logs to a SIEM for analysis.  
✅ **Threat Detection** – Develop **custom detection rules** to catch malicious activity.  
✅ **Incident Response & Forensics** – Simulate **attacks**, analyze logs, and document findings.  
✅ **Red vs. Blue Training** – Execute **offensive techniques** and detect them using defensive tools.

- [ ] Configure Active Directory Domain
- [ ] Set up DNS & optionally DHCP
- [ ] Create AD users

## 🖥️ Endpoint Deployment
- [ ] Deploy Windows 10/11 Workstations
- [ ] Join to Domain
- [ ] Create user sessions, simulate real usage
- [ ] Install Sysmon + SwiftOnSecurity config

## 🔐 SIEM (Wazuh) Setup
- [ ] Deploy Linux VM (Ubuntu recommended)
- [ ] Install Wazuh Stack (Wazuh Manager, Elasticsearch, Kibana, Filebeat)
- [ ] Open ports in firewall
- [ ] Access Wazuh Dashboard via browser

## 🔗 Agent Deployment
- [ ] Install Wazuh agent on Windows Server
- [ ] Install agent on all Windows clients
- [ ] Register agents with Wazuh Manager
- [ ] Confirm logs received

## 🔎 Log Collection Validation
- [ ] View EventLogs, Sysmon events in Wazuh UI
- [ ] Simulate:
  - [ ] Failed logins
  - [ ] PowerShell execution
  - [ ] RDP usage
- [ ] Confirm rules fired, alerts generated

## 🌐 Network Visibility
- [ ] Deploy Suricata or Zeek on dedicated VM
- [ ] Mirror VLAN traffic to sensor (if possible)
- [ ] Send logs to Wazuh via Filebeat

## 💥 Threat Simulation & Detection
- [ ] Install Atomic Red Team on a test endpoint
- [ ] Run:
  - [ ] T1059 – PowerShell execution
  - [ ] T1110 – Brute-force attempt
  - [ ] T1055 – Process injection
- [ ] Confirm alerts appear in Wazuh
- [ ] Analyze rules, tag with MITRE ATT&CK

## 📊 Dashboarding & Alerting
- [ ] Create Kibana dashboards:
  - [ ] Failed logins
  - [ ] Top processes
  - [ ] Alerts by severity
- [ ] Build custom detection rules in Wazuh
- [ ] Link rules to techniques</summary></phase1>

# <phase2><summary>Skill Expansion & Tool Exploration (Phase 2)

## 🔹 Splunk SIEM (Free Tier)
- [ ] Deploy Splunk Free Edition (500MB/day)
- [ ] Forward logs from one Windows client
- [ ] Practice SPL (Search Processing Language)
- [ ] Replicate Wazuh detections in Splunk
- [ ] Create basic dashboards and alerts

## 🔹 ELK Stack (Standalone)
- [ ] Deploy vanilla ELK (Elasticsearch + Logstash + Kibana)
- [ ] Forward logs from endpoints or test logs
- [ ] Create custom ingestion pipelines with Logstash
- [ ] Visualize data in Kibana
- [ ] Compare ELK with Wazuh experience

## 🔹 Zeek (Bro) Network Monitoring
- [ ] Install Zeek on a sensor VM
- [ ] Send VLAN traffic via mirror or tap interface
- [ ] Analyze:
  - [ ] DNS logs
  - [ ] HTTP logs
  - [ ] SSL, SSH activity
- [ ] Forward Zeek logs to ELK or Wazuh

## 🔹 Advanced Threat Simulation
- [ ] Use MITRE Caldera for red team automation
- [ ] Write detection rules based on Caldera activity
- [ ] Map alerts to MITRE ATT&CK Navigator

## 🔹 Detection Engineering Practice
- [ ] Write Sigma rules based on log observations
- [ ] Convert Sigma to Wazuh/Splunk detection syntax
- [ ] Build a “Detection Catalog” in GitHub
  - [ ] Detection name
  - [ ] Trigger method
  - [ ] Log source
  - [ ] Tool used (Wazuh, Splunk, etc.)
  - [ ] MITRE ID</summary></phase2>
