# **Part 1: Basic Setup**

------

## ðŸ”¹ Hardware

In terms of hardware, this will all be dependent on how many different VMs you would like to have and what kinds of things you would like to perform. For reference, this project will be run on:

* Ryzen 7 7700x (8 cores, 16 threads) 
* 32GB of RAM
* As much storage as I have available!

Purchasing older hardware second-hand could be a good option to get things up and running. In general CPU compute (particularly core/thread count), RAM, and storage will be the most important factors as to how your network will perform and how many VMs you can run simultaneously.

## ðŸ”¹ Virtualization

Here is a list of things that will be used:

1. <u>VMWare Workstation</u>: To setup all of the virtual machines, I will be using VMware Workstation. There are other options like VirtualBox and Windows Hyper-V, but for now I will stick with VMware.  

2. <u>Virtual Machines</u>: As of writing this first section, the different VMs that will be used will be a mixture of Windows & Linux. Eventually I'd like to have different services running on a variety of different machines in the network and have an external Kali VM that will be used to create traffic and generate alerts. For this first section we can just focus on Windows hosts such as Win10/11, Windows Server, pfSense for our firewall, and a couple of Linux hosts such as Ubuntu and Fedora.

## ðŸ”¹ Topology

Lastly for this section we will be following this topology:

![topology map](https://github.com/alexh200/blue-team-homelab/blob/main/basic-setup/topology.png?raw=true)

**Management Network** (<u>VLAN 1</u>) - This will be used to configure critical security infrastructure.

**Corporate Network** (<u>VLAN 1</u>0) - This represents the LAN for a corporate network and only has access to the simulated internet. User workstations and company servers run here.

**Corporate Security** (<u>VLAN 20</u>) - This represents a security team working at the organization to retrieve logs. Notice that the security network has access to the corporate network but not the other way around. We will allow this network to have access to the actual internet for various things.

**Hacker Network** (<u>VLAN 30</u>) - This represents bad actors from the internet trying to breach and gain access to the corporate network.

Shoutout to <u>@facyber</u> for the inspiration on the topology! (https://facyber.me/posts/blue-team-lab-guide-part-1/)

To create these VLANs in our virtual network, we will be creating networks within VMware workstation (or whatever hypervisor you are using). To do this in VMware:

1. Edit -> Virtual Network Editor -> Change Settings (might have to provide admin credentials).

2. Here we will add 4 networks and name them accordingly (I had to rename some once they were added):

   * vmnet1 (**Subnet Address**: <u>10.0.1.0</u>) - Management (*VLAN 1*)
   * vmnet10 (**Subnet Address**: <u>10.0.10.0</u>) - Corporate Network (*VLAN 10*)
   * vmnet20 (**Subnet Address**: <u>10.0.20.0</u>) - Corporate Security (*VLAN 20*)
   * vmnet30 (**Subnet Address**: <u>10.0.30.0</u>) - Hacker Network (*VLAN 30*)


   Make sure that all of these are set to host-only as we want to create our own virtual private network. We also want to uncheck use local DHCP service since we will have a DHCP server on our firewall and a windows server machine that will handle ip addressing. This is what our current configuration should look like:
